#Declare a variable named my_hero that the following sentence using a tab:
#'My hero is x and his famous quote is y.' Where x is role_model and y is famous_quote. Print the my_hero variable.

my_hero = '\tMy hero is ' + role_model + ' and his famous quote is ' + famous_quote + '.'
print(my_hero)

#Declare a variable named my_favs that creates the following sentence and returns a new line after each numbered item. 
#'This is what I like: 1. hobby 2. fav_color 3. fav_song
#Print the my_favs variable.

my_favs = 'This is what I like: \n1. ' + hobby + '\n2. ' + fav_color + '\n3. ' + fav_song
print(my_favs)

#4 Variables with a Number value
#Declare variables named age, weight, shoe_size, fav_number, yen_rate, bitcoin_value, todays_temperature, hawaii_popuation, countries_traveled, number_of_siblings

#Assign your own number values to each variable and print each variable.

age = 68
print(age)
weight = 168
print(weight)
shoe_size = 11
print(shoe_size)
fav_number = 3
print(fav_number)
yen_rate = 110
print(yen_rate)
bitcoin_value = 10000
print(bitcoin_value)
todays_temperature = 78.1
print(todays_temperature)
hawaii_popuation = 1200000
print(hawaii_popuation)
countries_traveled = 25
print(countries_traveled)
